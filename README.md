# 🚴‍♂️ Smart Fare Optimization: A Machine Learning Approach to Dynamic Pricing in Ride-Sharing

## 📌 Project Overview

Most ride-sharing platforms rely on basic, time-based fare strategies that don’t account for real-world complexity. This project introduces a **machine learning–based dynamic pricing model** designed to improve fare accuracy and business profitability by adapting prices in real time.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to build a **dynamic pricing system** that:

- Factors in **booking time**, **loyalty status**, and **expected ride duration**
- Responds to **real-time demand and market signals**
- Maximizes **customer satisfaction** through fairer and more personalized pricing
- Increases **revenue** and **profit margins**

---

## 🧠 Approach & Methodology

- 🔍 **Comparative Modeling:** Tested **12 ML algorithms** under **3 experimental setups**
- 📊 **Feature Engineering:** Included time, duration, loyalty tier, and contextual ride data
- ⚙️ **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **R² Score:** `0.84` (high accuracy)
  - **RMSE:** `$68`
  - **MAE:** `$53`

## 💰 Simulation Results

A controlled test involving **100 users** was conducted to simulate the model's business impact:

> **📈 Projected Net Profit: `$2,400` per 100 users**
